 This Repo contains source code for the game which was developed for Global Game Jam 2022<br>
 The Theme for the GGJ this year was: Duality... The idea for this years theme was as follows:<br>
 
 > A mechanic where player can direct a magical beam of light by reflecting it from mirrors and splitters to hit a acromatric world filled with furniture to give a blast of colour.
 > Each level will focus on different furniture items the player must hit simultaneously.<br><br>
 > The game can also feature a multiplayer mode where the players can compete to hit more 
 > objectives than the opponent to win. <br>
 
 The game was developed in 48 hours and further improved in following month, with hand drawn art style and a functioning multiplayer mode.<br> The project was submitted and uploaded on itch.io which can be played here:
